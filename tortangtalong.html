    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This incrdeible egg...plant dish uses eggs and eggplant together
        to make one of my favourite Filipino foods, tortang talong! This

        <li>Puncture eggplants with a knife to prevent bursting in air fryer. 
            Coat in oil and air fry for 30 mins at 400 degrees turning once or bake in oven 350Â° for 1 hour. 
            Meanwhile cool garlic, onions, pork and tomato till cooked.</li>
        <li>Allow eggplant to cool and gently peel skin off of eggplant. 
            Season with salt and pepper. Flatten eggplant gently with the back of a fork.</li>
        <li>Dip eggplant into eggs. I add a tad of fish sauce to the eggs. 
            Dredge in cornstarch which is also optional.</li> 
        <li> Fry in 2 tbsp oil over medium heat. Cook 3-4 minutes per side. 
            I spoon pork mixture onto eggplant as it cooks.
